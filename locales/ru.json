      "compositions": {
        "pizza": "To paraphrase Potter Stewart, stunt pizza is very much an \"I know it when I see it\" situation in which a pizzeria is seeking to create not only fine flavors, but also that extra \"wow\" factor that moves the imagination and accumulates Instagram likes. Think driving the carb counters mad and topping a pizza crust with mac & cheese, or better yet, another slice of pizza.",
        "bagel": "The pizza bagel is—simply—traditional pizza toppings (tomato sauce, cheese, pepperoni) on a (usually) toasted bagel. And when pizza's on a bagel, you can eat pizza any time.",
        "breakfast": "Well, it's exactly what it sounds like: the pizza \"vehicle\" is used to facilitate traditional breakfast foods in order to fashion a pie worthy of the day's most important meal. Breakfast pizza commonly features potatoes, bacon and/or sausage, cheese. But it almost certainly requires a cracked, golden egg on top of it all to truly be considered a breakfast pie. You don't have to eat this pie in the morning, but it's definitely become a brunchtime staple.",
        "california": "Generally wood-fired and often single-serving, California-style pizza is often compared to Neapolitan. But like the rad new kid from Malibu who shakes things up at a stuffy new school in a classic movie, it doesn't play by the rules. “When you say California pizza, it has nothing to do with the dough itself. California has to do with toppings,\" says Thomas McNaughton of San Francisco's Flour + Water. Basically, it's because of California that pizzerias now obsess over ultra-fresh ingredients and put things like broccoli and fennel on pies.",
        "chain": "It's Domino's. It's Pizza Hut. It's Papa Johns. It's Little Caesars. Essentially, it's \"fast food pizza.\" You might recognize it specifically by its chewy, consistently cooked crust (more on that, below), and standard-tasting cheese and sauce, relative to more colorful local, \"real\" pizzerias, at least. Look. It is what it is. But you simply cannot deny chain pizza's overwhelming popularity in America. And frankly, sometimes it does hit the spot. It's OK. We won't tell anyone how much you secretly love it.",
        "colorado": "A massive pizza with a honey-kissed, doughy crust loaded with so many toppings they have to create a folded-over containment wall around the crust just to keep it all in. Oh, and at founding pizzeria Beau Jo’s, it’s sold by the pound.",
        "detroit": "It's rectangular rather than round, with caramelized Wisconsin brick cheese giving the edge a crunch (no shredding here) that gives to a surprisingly fluffy, thick crust. That brick cheese goes down first, then the sauce tops it off. If you haven’t noticed, it’s having a moment, with pizzerias all over the nation adopting it, and big brands like DiGiorno and Detroit-based Little Caesars bringing it to the mainstream.",
        "frenchBread": "A classic of latchkey kids and college students, it’s simply pizza toppings thrown on a split baguette, then tossed in the oven until it's bubbly and extra crispy. Just don’t call it garlic bread with sauce.",
        "fried": "The name might lead you to believe that a pie is battered and then deep-fried like something straight out of the Texas State Fair. But fried pizza is much more nuanced, and dare we say, more delicate, than that. There are two main styles: a pizza fritte, which is essentially a fried calzone, and the much more complex montanara, in which dough is first flash-fried before being topped with sauce and cheese, and baked at super-high heat to finish. The result is a pizza that is not oily, but instead one that rests on a pillowy crust.",
        "greek": "Most prevalent in New England and the Midwest—thanks to the massive influx of Greek immigrants who opened diners and pizzerias in the areas—it’s a pan-style pizza with soft, doughy crust and a bit of crispiness on the bottom.",
        "grilled": "Grilled pizza is one of the rare styles of pie where the pizza itself never needs to be placed inside an oven. This non-traditional method of pizza-making involves brushing the crust with heavy coats of oil before placing it on a grate over hot coals. The dough will take several turns (ideally charring parts of it) before toppings—your standard cheeses, meats, and veggies—are added after the last flip, and given time to melt into each other and the crust in classic pizza fashion. It's super-crunchy, kind of oily, sometimes quite charred, but most importantly, it makes you wonder if ovens are truly necessary to make a great pizza. In this case, the answer is a hard no.",
        "indian": "While it might sound like it, “Indian Pizza” is not a euphemism for cheese-and-sauce-stuffed naan. Nor is it even a pizza necessarily made on a naan crust (though it can be). Indian Pizza simply denotes a pizza crust that swaps standard toppings like pepperoni and barbecue chicken for flavor-packed Indian food favorites like saag paneer and tandoori chicken, as well as popular ingredients used in Indian cuisine like fenugreek and chutney. These ingredients are layered on, usually with plenty of cheese, and baked off like a standard pie. Options range from mom-and-pop versions that stick to a simple formula to chaffy-takes that experiment with crust types and topping combinations.",
        "jumbo": "In an era when traditional slices don't always meet our \"more everything!\" needs, the jumbo slice is there to quite literally fulfill even the most jaded by-the-slice consumer. This behemoth of a slice—while certainly significantly larger than what you’d find in a classic slice shop—is simply New York-style pizza, just done bigger.",
        "lahmajoun": "Also known as Turkish pizza or Armenian pizza, lahmajoun is... well, not exactly pizza. It’s an extremely thin, round flatbread layered with ground beef or lamb, minced vegetables, and a bouquet of spices that's been re-branded \"pizza.\"",
        "newHeaven": "New Haven pizza is instantly recognizable for a few reasons. First off, the extreme temperatures of the (mainly) wood give the crust a charred, toothsome hardness, and an often warped, knobby, asymmetrical appearance. The dough is generally left to ferment much longer than traditional pizzas, and the pies themselves are commonly topped with sparse hits of tomatoes, cheese, meats, and in many cases white sauce and clams (any New Haven pizza joint worth their salt will have this, by the way). This certainly isn't the most beautiful looking pizza. In fact, sometimes it can look downright goofy. But that hasn't stopped it from being one of the most storied pizza styles in the entire world, and one of the most beloved regional foods in America.",
        "newYork": "Simply put: This is pizza. When you conjure an image of the Platonic ideal of what a pizza should be, you're probably visualizing a box of full of New York slices. Hand-tossed, round pies with a thin(ish), crispy crust (like its Neapolitan predecessor), featuring a light layer of heavily seasoned tomato sauce, topped with gooey, \"pull-able\" mozzarella cheese, and commonly served via solo slice and topped with pepperoni: This is pizza as you know it.",
        "ohioValley": "Oh boy. Perhaps the oddest entry on this list, Ohio Valley style—depending on your opinion—is either the dark hose, regional hero of the pizza world, or a tomato sauce-laden abomination. You have thin crust, square-cut pizzas that are topped with cheese and pepperoni… but only after they leave the oven. So yes, the grated mozzarella and meats are served cold. The thought is that the heat from the pizza will slightly melt the (still-cold) lumps of cheese. Spoiler alert: It often doesn't. But the hot-cold sensation from the uncooked cheese is truly unlike anything else on this list. To be honest, it kind of gives off Lunchables vibes. And that isn't always a bad thing.",
        "oldForge": "If you haven't been to Northeastern Pennsylvania (otherwise known as NEPA), there's a solid chance you've never seen or heard about Old Forge pizza. It basically looks like a thick, Sicilian pie, inside a deep-dish tray (but NEVER call this a \"pie,\" it is a tray. They will yell at you). The dough is generally a little lighter than traditional deep-dish, and it has a distinctly chewy center. There's two types of Old Forge pizza: red and white. Red includes a sweet red sauce (duh), thinly cut onions, and blends of cheeses that can include mozzarella, Cheddar, or even American. White is generally stuffed with dough on the bottom and top of the tray, with a ton of cheese, but zero sauce. If you couldn't already tell, Old Forge is definitely an outlier in the pizza world.",
        "quadCities": "Triangles? Quad Cities pizza don’t need your triangles: These round pies are cut into strips—think Pokey Stix, if you went to a Big Ten school—using scissors. It’s also got a malt-heavy crust that gives it a nutty quality, a spicy sauce, and toppings hidden under an extremely thick layer of cheese.",
        "neapolitan": "It is, quite literally, the granddaddy of all pizza. This is pizza as it was originally intended. The dough is fermented anywhere from a couple hours to several days, and gives the pizza a soft, easy-to-chew mouthfeel, with a hint of oven-kissed crunch along the bottom, often with delicious dough bubbles lacing the crust. The tops of the pies are commonly peppered with fresh tomatoes, herbs, and other veggies, with a thin layer of red sauce, and a relatively sparse application of cheese (the iconic margherita being the most popular preparation). ",
        "roman": " To be sure, there is LOTS of pizza in Rome, but in America referring to \"Roman-style\" pizza generally means pizza al taglio, which consists of rectangular trays of a light, airy crust that offers an almost bread-like interior. The topping schemes can lean extremely simple, such as a sparse layer of tomato sauce (rossa) or mere olive oil and sea salt (bianca), but establishments often branch out into a variety of accoutrements from thinly sliced potatoes and rosemary to zucchini to prosciutto. These trays will line the counter side-by-side as customers indicate their selections and gesture with their hands to indicate how big a piece, which will be weighed to determine the price.",
        "soup": "Super-healthy vegetables bathe in a bowl of low-fat lentil soup in this easy winter warmer.",
        "chicken": "Chicken soup is like food for the soul and this one will give you an instant pick-me-up.",
        "corn": "Get the week off to a great start with this quick and easy soup.",
        "cream": "Super easy and absolutely delicious, this cream of cauliflower soup is bound to please.",
        "asian": "Combine fresh Asian greens with chicken and noodles to create this winter warming soup.",
        "pumpkin": "This is Australia's #1 most-cooked soup recipe of all time and taste.com.au members are raving about it. Find out why!",
        "shank": "Cook this soup on a nice gentle heat for a long time and you'll be rewarded with a heart-warming dinner that's still low in fat.",
        "vegetable": "Warm up the middle of the week with a soup which is just brimming with veggies and flavour!",
        "moroccan": "This easy soup comes highly recommended from many all peoples.",
        "curried": "Curry powder makes this lentil and pumpkin soup zing.",
        "pasta": " looks a lot like traditional spaghetti. However, it’s more round, and there’s a hole through the middle that gives each noodle a hollow center. This makes it a little thicker than spaghetti noodles. When cooked in soups, pasta dishes, and casseroles, it hoards extra sauce. That’s the superpower of bucatini.",
        "fettuccine": "Like a flat spaghetti noodle — that’s fettuccini. It’s a thicker and more dense noodle. It’s fairly wide, so it works well with chunky meat sauces, unlike other types of long pasta. Of course, creamy alfredo sauce tossed in with fettuccine is a dynamic duo.",
        "linguine": "Linguine resembles fettuccine, but it’s not as wide. It’s a common noodle pairing for seafood dishes, mixed with white wine sauces and clams and mussels. Any cream-based or white wine sauce tastes like a dream with linguine noodles.",
        "papardelle": "If you think long pasta can’t get any wider than fettuccine, think again. Pappardelle pasta noodles are even better at meshing with rich, meat-based sauces. For example, it’s most commonly used in ragu or bolognese, but it’s also great for seafood pasta dishes. It’s big, bad, and sturdy, so you can throw any hearty sauce its way.",
        "cavatappi": "This hollow, spiral-shaped noodle is also referred to as double elbow pasta. The multiple twist and turns provide lots of surface area to get coated with sauce and trap it inside, plus the extra length gives more chew. Yes, it’s great in macaroni and cheese).",
        "desert": "Just when you thought apple pie couldn't get any better, this recipe raises the bar like no other. Truly our best-ever, make this classic for a get-together and you might not have any leftovers to bring home. Top off this warm, melt-in-your mouth pie with a sprinkle of cinnamon and a scoop of ice cream.",
        "almond": "First up: This almond malai kulfi is like happiness condensed in a matki. To make it extra special, top it off with dry fruits and make sure it is absolutely chilled before serving. So creamy, so simple - it hits all the right notes.",
        "tart":"Sinful, rich and creamy, this recipe is the perfect finish to a meal. Tip: Make the lemon tart a day ahead, and store it in the refrigerator. Spruce it up with lemon rind, and trust us - this indulgent dessert really is as yummy as it looks.",
        "pistachio": "Flavoured with elaichi and pista, take phirni to a whole new level with this exquisite recipe. Serve chilled in mitti ke kasore for a festive occasion and bask in the glory. This phirni is made of sugar and love.",
